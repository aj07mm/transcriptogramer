Description: R package for transcriptional analysis based on transcriptograms,
    a method to analyze transcriptomes that projects expression values on a
    set of ordered proteins, arranged such that the probability that gene
    products participate in the same metabolic pathway exponentially decreases
    with the increase of the distance between two proteins of the ordering.
    Transcriptograms are, hence, genome wide gene expression profiles that
    provide a global view for the cellular metabolism, while indicating gene
    sets whose expression are altered.
